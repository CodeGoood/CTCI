# "alpha" controls the importance of "area".
# "beta" controls the importance of "pipe length".
# "gamma" controls the importance of "wind rules".
alpha 1.0
beta 1.0
gamma 1.0

# "restarts" mainly controls running time.
# If restarts = 1, then the program will totally evolve 2 runs
#                  and yield 2 layouts (1 layouts for each run).
# Normally, 10 or more is suggested.
restarts 9

# "popsize" controls computational resources consumption.
# The more difficult the problem is, the larger the "popsize" should be.
# Normally, 1000 is suggested.
popsize 2000

# "resolution" is used to align modules.
# Examples:
#  2: any values less than 10^-2 will be discarded.
#  1: any values less than 10^-1 will be discarded.
#  0: any values less than 10^0 will be discarded.
# -1: any values less than 10^1 will be discarded.
# -2: any values less than 10^2 will be discarded.
